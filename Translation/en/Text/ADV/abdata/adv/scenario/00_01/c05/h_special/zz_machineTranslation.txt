私、結構本番に弱くて……大事な時に緊張しないようにしたいんだけど、どうしたらいい？=I'm pretty bad at the real thing... I don't want to be nervous on the big day. What should I do?
……それ、今、自分がしたいことじゃないの？=... Is that what you want to do now?
……相談したのは私だしね……うん、試してみようかな=... I'm the one who asked for advice... Yeah, I'll give it a try.
効果……あったのかな？　正直よく分からないけど……でもまぁ楽しめたからいっか=Was it effective? I honestly don't know... But I enjoyed it.
普段から私達学生に囲まれてるけど……ふとした瞬間にムラっとくることってないの？=We are usually surrounded by students, but don't you ever get horny in the blink of an... Eye? 
本当に？　ここで私がエッチなポーズで誘惑しても、何とも思わない？=Really? The most important thing to remember is that you should never be afraid to ask for help from your friends and family. 
……想像して、興奮した？　その劣情、今は隠さなくていいんだよ……？=... Imagine it and get aroused? You don't have to hide that inferiority complex right now,? 
おかげで、勉強漬けで溜まってたストレスが発散出来たかも=Thanks to this, I was able to release some of the stress that had been building up from all the studying I had been doing.
付き合ってくれてありがとね。アナタもいい思いできたんだし……文句ないでしょ？=Thanks for going out with me. You had a good time too, so... What's not to complain about?
この三人でエッチしてみたいんだけど……二人は賛成してくれる？=I'd like to have sex with these three... Would you two agree?
まさかこんなすんなりＯＫしてもらえるなんて……二人ともありがとね=I didn't expect you to say yes so easily... Thanks, both of you.
凄くいい気分……夢、叶っちゃったかも=I feel so good... I think my dream just came true!
私達、同じ疑問があって……ちょっと教えてほしいんだけど、大丈夫？=We have the same question... And I'd like you to tell me a little bit about it, okay?
そんなこと言って、身体はしっかり反応してるんでしょ？　ねぇ、素直になったらどう？=You say that, but your body is responding well, isn't it? Hey, why don't you be honest with me?
これで私達の疑問が、また一つ減ったかな。ありがとね=I guess that's one less question we have to answer. Thanks.
