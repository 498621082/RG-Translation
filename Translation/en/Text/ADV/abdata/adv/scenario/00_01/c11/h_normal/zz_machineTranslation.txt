ねえ、キミとイイコトしたいんだけど……いい？=Hey, can I have sex with you at?
話早いじゃん。それじゃ、よろしく=That was quick. Well then, nice to meet you.
ねえ、あたしとエッチしない？=Hey, will you have sex with me?
ねぇ、エッチしない？　いいでしょ？=Hey, do you want to have sex? You know what I'm saying?
二人とも満足できたね～=You both got your money's worth!
エッチの誘い、断らなくて良かったよ=I'm glad I didn't turn down your offer of sex.
まだ余韻が続いてる気がする……もしかして、キミもそうなの？=I feel like I'm still lingering... Maybe you are too?
気持ちいい時間だったね～。はぁ、カロリー使ったから、暫く動きたくないよ=That was a nice time! Sigh, I used up so many calories, I don't want to move for a while!
あたし、イキすぎ……自分でもビックリだよ=I'm so excited... I'm surprised at myself.
ここまでイッちゃうなんて、思ってなかったよ……=I never thought I'd come this far...
イキすぎて、変になっちゃいそうだったよ……=I almost went crazy from all the cumming...
あー、いっぱいイッちゃった……すごかったー……=Oh, I came a lot... It was amazing...
らめぇ……もう無理ぃ……=I can't take it anymore...
からら……おかしくなっちゃっらぁ……=Karara... I'm going crazy...
あれ？　一度も出してないのに終わり？=Huh? You're done without ever serving?
ん？　あたししかイッてないのに終わっちゃうの？=Hmm? I'm the only one who's cumming, and it's over?
ん～、キミをイカせる気満々だったんだけどね……=I was so ready to make you cum...
……まぁ、キミがそれでいいなら、終わりにしよっか=Well, if you're okay with that, I guess we're done.
ん～、ちょっと消化不良……かな？=Hmmm, a little indigestion?
一人だけ気持ちいい思いをするなんて……ずるくない？=Isn't it unfair that only one person gets to feel good?
はぁ……キミにはがっかりだよ=Huh... You disappoint me.
自分が気持ち良ければ、それでいいわけ～？=As long as it makes you feel good, that's all that matters?
……何だったの、この時間=... What was that, this time?
ま、こーいうこともあるよね……いや、ナイって、これ=Well, it happens... No, it's not like that.
……何の為にあたしを誘ったの？=What did you ask me out for?
誘っといて、これ？　そういう特殊なプレイだったりして……=You invited me to this? It's that kind of special play...
いやぁ、スッキリできたよ=Well, that was refreshing.
キミを誘ってよかった。ありがとねー=I'm glad I invited you. Thanks.
エッチって気持ちいいね……ありがと、付き合ってくれて=Sex feels so good... Thanks for hanging out with me.
二人ともイケて良かったよ。……一応これでも気を遣ってたんだよ？=I'm glad you both got hot... I was still paying attention to this, in case you were wondering, right?
……ここまで来て止めにするなんて……酷くなぁい？=It's not too much to ask you to stop after coming all this way, is it?
なに？　急ぎの用でもあったの？=What is it? What's the rush?
ん～、せめて一回はイキたかったんだけどね=Hmmm... I was hoping to cum at least once.
本番はこれからだったのに終わり？　えぇ～……=The show was just about to start, and now it's over? Oh, no...
全員、エッチに夢中になっちゃってたね……=All of you were getting so sexually active...
激しいエッチだったね……はぁ、大満足だよ=That was some intense sex... Haha, very satisfying.
イッたのがあたしだけって……なんか恥ずかしいんだけど……=It's kind of embarrassing that I'm the only one who came...
二人とも、射精してないのに満足したってこと？　変わってるね～=You mean both of us were satisfied even though we didn't ejaculate? That's strange.
呼びつけてごめんね。じゃあ、さっそく始めよっか=Sorry for calling you out. Well, let's get started.
キミだってそうじゃない？　わざわざ付き合ってくれるんだもん=You don't either, do you? You go out of your way to keep me company.
二人は射精出来たかもしれないけど……あたしはイケてないからね？=You two may have ejaculated... But I didn't, did I?
あたしだけ仲間外れにされたってこと？　酷くない？=So I'm the only one who's been left out? Isn't that awful?
……あたしイッてないよ？　二人もイッてないでしょ？　なのに終わっちゃうの？=I didn't come, did I? You two didn't come, did you? And it's over?
……ふーん、今回は様子見って感じ？=... Hmmm, I guess we'll see how it goes this time?
みんなイッたの……夢じゃなかったんだ……すごぉ=We all came... It wasn't a dream... Wow!
三人エッチの醍醐味だよね……全員イクのって……=That's the best part of having sex with three people... When they all cum...
あたし達はイッたけど……キミはまだでしょ？　終わっていいの？=We came... But you didn't. Are you sure you want to finish?
キミがイッてないの……結構心残りなんだけど……いいの？=I'm pretty disappointed that you didn't cum... Is that okay?
うー、イキたかったなぁ……=I wish I could have cum...
自分一人が満足したらそれでいいの？　あたし達は～？=Is it enough if you are satisfied with yourself? What about us?
いやいや、消化不良なんだけど……=No, no, no, I have indigestion...
……これで終わり？=... Is that it?
気持ちよかったぁ……二人ともイケて、嬉しかったよ=It felt so good... I was so happy that we both came.
なんかさ、キミとイクと、同じ景色を見てるみたいで嬉しいんだよねー……=I'm kind of glad that when I cum with you, it's like we're looking at the same scenery...
ごめんね……ちょっと限界がきちゃって……=Sorry... I'm a little out of my depth...
あたしがだらしないばっかりに……ごめんね=I'm sorry I've been so sloppy.
攻めてるだけでも楽しいもんだね～=It's fun just to be on the offensive!
あぁ、楽しかった。また、エッチな声をいっぱい聞かせてね～=Ah, it was fun. Please let me hear your naughty voice a lot again~!
ごめん……なんか、その……日和っちゃったかも……=I'm sorry... I guess I just... Had a bad day...
あたしが誘ったのにごめんね……=I'm sorry I invited you...
なんか、キミの温もりが欲しくなって……お願い、付き合って……？=I just wanted your warmth... Please go out with me?
それは知ってる……けど、いいでしょ？　付き合ってくれない？=I know that... But come on. Will you go out with me?
お風呂なら汚れてもいいかなーって。だから……いい？=I was thinking that a bath would be a good place to get dirty. So... Okay?
ねえねえ、この三人でエッチしてみない？　多分楽しいよ=Hey, hey, why don't the three of us have sex? It'd probably be fun.
えへへ、ま、この二人ならそう言うよね。じゃ早速始めよ=Well, I guess they would say so, wouldn't they? Well, let's get started.
あたし……三人エッチしてみたいんだけど……どう？=I... Would like to have sex with three people... How about it?
へー、みんなけっこう乗り気じゃん？　じゃあ、始めよっか=Wow, everyone's pretty excited about it, huh? Well, let's get started.
今からあたしたちの相手をしてもらうから=You're going to have to deal with us now.
ちょっと頼みにくいんだけどさ……あたしと、エッチしてよ=I hate to ask you this, but... Will you have sex with me?
ありがとね、二人とも。あたし、頑張るよ=Thanks, you two. I'll do my best.
